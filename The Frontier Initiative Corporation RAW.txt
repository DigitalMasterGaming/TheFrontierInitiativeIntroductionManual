• Quarterly Reviews: Leadership will conduct a formal review of the manual and 
policies every quarter to ensure everything remains relevant and effective.
• Emergency Updates: In urgent situations, changes may be implemented 
immediately and reviewed after the fact to ensure compliance with TFIC’s values.
This section ensures that TFIC can adapt over time while keeping the membership 
informed and engaged. With a transparent process for amendments and a commitment 
to regular reviews, the organization will continue to thrive and grow as new challenges 
and opportunities arise.
